# Recipe Randomizer

Small tool I built for use at home. We have a lot of cookbooks and often browse for recipes that we then forget we want to make! This site allows us to keep a list of recipes, keeping track of what we've made and when, and let's us randomize the list so we can pick something out if we're not sure what to make.
